# SciCN


# Introduction
```

 we present SciCN, a dataset containing annotations of 3,500 abstracts of Chinese scientific papers. 
 
A total of 62,059 entities are manually annotated in six categories. 
 
 Compared to existing English scientific datasets, SciCN includes documents from a wider range of fields and on a larger scale. As baselines for investigating the properties of SciCN, we implement a variety of representative NER models. Experimental results show that SciCN is more challenging than other datasets, such as general and news datasets. In addition, previous studies have proved the effectiveness of lexicons in enhancing NER models. Motivated by this fact, we provide a scientific domain-specific lexicon. 
 
 Comparing our lexicon to other public lexicons of the general domain, we find that our lexicon provides a more significant performance gain. With the release of the SciCN dataset and pre-trained scientific lexicon, we hope to benchmark the NER task in the Chinese scientific domain and make progress for future research.
